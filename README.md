## Abstract

*Background* Subthalamic (STN) and pallidal (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) lead to significant improvements in the health related quality of life (HRQoL) in Parkinson’s Disease (PD). This improvement, however, although clinically relevant, remains moderate.
*Objectives* To identify factors that can improve HRQoL after DBS and to analyze whether the target is also a factor influencing HRQoL specifically in a group composed of older patients, with worse cognitive status and postural stability, all of which are criteria classically used to choose GPi instead of STN target.
*Methods* Retrospective, observational, single-center study with 138 PD (117 STN-DBS and 21 GPi-DBS). Using multivariable linear regression, we identified which variables have an impact on changes in HRQoL. HRQoL was assessed with the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Using propensity score matching, we compared the change in HRQoL between an STN subgroup and the GPI group.
*Results* Improved motor outcome (0.23, CI: [0.09, 0.37], p = 0.001), reduced pain 0.94, CI: [0.40,1.47], p = 0.0007) and improved apathy 0.58, CI: [0.20, 0.97], p = 0.003) contributed to improvements in HRQoL. In the matched cohort, the mean PDQ-39 summary index was 3.8 points better in the STN group than in the GPi group (p = 0.18).
*Conclusion* In a group that in many centers are typically recommended to undergo GPi-DBS, no HRQoL benefits were observed depending on the target. This may question the classical patient-specific approach to target selection. Motor outcome, pain and apathy are factors that individually influence HRQoL and should be carefully assessed after DBS.
